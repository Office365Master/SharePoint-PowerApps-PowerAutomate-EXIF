# SharePoint-PowerApps-PowerAutomate-EXIF
In this latest updated demo of this really awesome app I created using PowerApps, I showcase how I am able to extract EXIF metadata data properties including the Longitude, Latitude, Altitude,  Address, Basic Tags (outdoor / indoor / person), ThumbnailUrl, Camera Make, Model, blah, blah, blah all within a single Power Automate flow containing less than 20 steps in total, 10 of which are simply initializing and setting variables, with paging comes to a whooping 45 seconds on averages per 5000 photos processed from a SharePoint Site Assets Library containing over R10k of photos. About 25% of which are photos between 4MB and 20MB.  No Cognitive Services Computer Vision API. No complex code. No 4MB file limit.  Genuinely absolutely free ðŸ¤©.
